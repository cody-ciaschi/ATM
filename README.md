# ATM
This is a simple ATM written in React. It allows for Depositing and Withdrawing. The application will not allow overdrafts from the total account.

## Usage
- Make sure you are running Node.js version 14
- Clone the repo
- cd into directory and call `http-server -c-1`
- Have Fun!

## Future Improvements
In the future, I'm going to make some style changes using the material-ui libraries. I might also make a login feature / page to allow for multiple users.
